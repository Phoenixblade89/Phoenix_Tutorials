***Code Tutorials by Phoenixblade89***
<p>Hello everyone and welcome to my Tutorial Repository!</p>
<p>Throughout my education and real world experience I've picked up several different skills in different programming languages. This repo will contain various sets of example code that should help beginners make their way though their early programming life.</p>
<p><b>NOTE: I AM NOT A TEACHER!</b><br />These tutorials should be used by those who are interested in learning Software Development and Application Development skills, but nothing can replace a good mix of traditional education and real world experience.</p>
<p>After reviewing these tutorials, if you want to learn more seek out an educational institution! These people have years upon years of experience and can provide you with degrees/certifications that will help you find employment. I personally am fond of career colleges(like my alma mater, <a href="www.fountainheadcollege.edu">Fountainhead College of Technology</a>), but many large universities have excellent programs and professors that really care about the industry.</p>

<p>That being said here is a list of languages I plan on covering in these tutorials.
	<ol>
		<li>Java</li>
		<li>C#.NET</li>
		<li>C++</li>
		<li>C</li>
		<li>PHP</li>
		<li>Python</li>
		<li>SQL</li>
		<li>HTML5</li>
		<li>Javascript/jQuery</li>
		<li>ASP.NET</li>
	</ol>
Each of these projects will contain a README.md document explaining some of the basics of each language and where the tutorials stand to date.

<b>A note to contributors</b>
<p>Please feel free to fork this project into one of your own if you wish to make modifications to these tutorials. Comments on mistakes or possible places to improve are also very welcome.</p>
